As a primary instructor, I teach several core courses, including *Information and Network Security, Operating Systems, Information Network Security Lab, and Principles and Technologies of Blockchain*. I am also leading a **University-Industry Collaborative Education Program** by the *Ministry of Education of China* focused on cultivating a first-class teaching faculty for nurturing top-tier innovative talent in cyberspace security.

I am passionate about student mentorship, and I am proud of my students' many accomplishments. I have guided multiple undergraduate teams in the **National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship**; one team's project was designated as a "key support project" (top 2%) and received an "Excellent" rating upon completion, for which I was named an Outstanding Advisor. My students have also achieved significant success in national competitions. Most recently, teams I supervised won First Prize at the **2023 National College Student Information Security Contest** and First Prize at the **2023 China Graduate Cyber Security Innovation Competition**, earning me the Outstanding Advisor award at both events. Other notable achievements include a First Prize (Beijing region) at the **2023 "Internet+" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition** and a Second Prize at the **CCF & ATEC Collegiate Blockchain Security Technology and Innovation Competition**.

Furthermore, two of my students were selected for the inaugural **Student Innovation Funding Program** by the *Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)*. Of the six undergraduate students whose theses I have supervised, one was named a **"Outstanding Graduate of Beijing"**, and three others earned **"Outstanding Graduate of Beihang University"** honors. For my contributions to education, I have been honored with the Grand Prize for **Graduate Teaching Achievement** and the Second Prize for **Undergraduate Teaching Achievement** from *Beihang University*.
